ORP Numbering System:

Numbering system is developed in a similar manner to IP addresses:
XXX.XXX.XXX

Where each X can be any number from 0-9.
Meaing of each digit going from left to right:
Group 1:
    Dig 1 - Type - type of the part: 
        1: Plates
        2: Holders
        3: Wheels
        4: Connection rods

    Dig 2 - Category - category of the part:
        For type 1 (Plates):
            1: Rectangular
            2: Circular
            3: Oval
            4: Special
            5: Weird
        For type 2 (Holders):
            1: Motors
            2: Sensors
            3: Microcontrollers and SBCs
            4: Cameras
            5: Batteries
            6: Other
            7: Special
        For type 3 (Wheels):
            1. Smooth
            2. Normal
            3. Terrain
            4. Spikes
            5. Special 
        For type 4 (Connection rods):
            1. One hole
            2. Multi holes
            3. Special

    Dig 3 - Sub category - additional sub cattegory describing each part:

Group 2:
    Dig 1 - Manufacturing - methods using which the part can be manufactured:
        Coded in binary and displayed in decimal, 1 if possible 0 otherwise:
            Bit 1: 3D printing
            Bit 2: CNC machining
            Bit 3: laser cutting

            When all methods are allowed = 7
            When only 3D printing = 1
            3D printing + cnc machining = 3
            Only laser cutting = 4

    Dig 2 - number of subparts:
        range: 1-9, if number of subparts is bigger then 9 should be used

    Dig 3 - Custom fields

Group 3:
    All digits used to code the most important dimension in milimeters.
    Plates - diameter or diagonal.
    Holders - diameter or diagonal.
    Wheels - diameter.
    Connection rods - height.
